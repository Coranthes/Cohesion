Cohesion Resource Packs can be used together or individually.  Created with the intention of use with svenhjol's mods, Charm and Strange. 
I still have *a lot* of work to do on this project.  

# How to Use:
To use this as a resource pack, click "Clone or download" then "Download ZIP" and place it in
%appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks 
or 
~/.minecraft/resourcepacks 
depending on your operating system.
